## Starting the Frontend Server

To start the Angular development server, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd note-manager
   ```
2. **Install the Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
